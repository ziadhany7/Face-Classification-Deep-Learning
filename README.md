# Face-Classification-Deep-Learning
Overview: 
This project compares three state-of-the-art architectures for face classification: ResNet50, 
Xception, and DenseNet121. Each architecture has unique structural innovations that 
contribute to its performance. This document explains each model in detail, highlighting 
their components, step-by-step implementation, and visual representations. Finally, we 
discuss their training and evaluation results.
